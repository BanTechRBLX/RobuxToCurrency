# RobuxToCurrency
This Chrome extension is inspired by Crazyman32's [ROBUX to Dollars Display extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/robux-to-dollars-display/cjidafeffoionbhpaknjkmpgikdceojm).

As a UK developer, constantly searching the conversion of how much I would get in GBP for a particular DevEx amount, I decided it was time to implement it into an extension so I could see at the click of a button. This combined with CM32's extension breaking recently due to Roblox UI changes and a move away from R$ as the symbol for Robux provided the perfect opportunity to get two birds with one stone - fix the extension, and extend it with an additional currency.

## Installation

To install the extension, whilst it isn't on the Chrome Web Store, you can either grab the entire repository, and save it somewhere locally on your PC in a folder. Navigate to Chrome's "Manage extensions" page and click "Load unpacked", then select the folder.

That's it!

## Usage

To use the extension, first navigate to a www.roblox.com URL.

For the navigation bar, you'll need to hover over the Robux amount and the converted currency will appear above "Buy Robux".

For all other displays of Robux you own, the converted amount will appear next to it in parentheses. See your Money page by clicking on your Robux in the navigation bar.

To swap currencies, simply click on the extension icon (most useful to have this pinned so it's always visible). The icon will change to reflect the selected currency, and all currently-open tabs at www.roblox.com will update their display to show the updated currency selection.
